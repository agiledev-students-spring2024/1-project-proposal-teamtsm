# Project Proposal: Video Analyzer 


### What & Why?
We would like to develop a web or mobile app for users to do mock interviews and able to evaluate their performance by themselves.


### For Whom?
The aiming people for this app is for many new graduate students likes us who are desperate on finding sde jobs and have no prior experience on interview.


### How?
Users can upload videos or audios locally from their device or authorized cloud platform or record them instantly. The video will be saved in cloud data base and the generated unique url will be sent to the online video trans and analyzer called AssemblyAI.


### Scope
More to pay attention is the transition of the format of files and the authorization for keeping each individual user's privacy.
